Almodovar has never shied away from telling his own stories, particularly about the women in his life, but there’s a poignancy to the way he approaches it here that he hasn’t really reached before. It’s largely due to how he places himself in the center of the story, not as an observer or cinematic memory but as the protagonist.</description></item><item><title>The Killing of a Sacred Deer movie review (2017)</title><link>/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-2017.html</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-killing-of-a-sacred-deer-2017.html</guid><description>Colin Farrell, reuniting with Lanthimos and a bit bushier and grayer than before, plays Dr. Steven Murphy, a noted and respected surgeon.

The last years of his life, his biographer Bill Zehme tells me, were spent in mostly unemployed show-biz free fall.

They cut the nets of a Cajun fisherman, they "borrow" three Cajun boats, and they mock the Cajuns by firing blank machine-gun rounds at them. The Cajuns are not amused. By the film's end, guardsmen will have been shot dead, impaled, hung, drowned in quicksand, and attacked by savage dogs. And all the time they try to protect themselves with a parody of military discipline, while they splash in circles and rescue helicopters roar uselessly overhead.</description></item><item><title>Kayla Swift Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</title><link>/kayla-swift-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-33272-html.html</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 Jul 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/kayla-swift-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-33272-html.html</guid><description>Kayla Swift is an American entertainer and model.

Dau, so fiery and magnetic in the recent “Oslo,” is gentler and softer here, more pulled into himself and more mischievous; a scene of him dancing to love songs while frying fish is both joyous and devastating.</description></item><item><title>Is Jana Kramer Pregnant?
